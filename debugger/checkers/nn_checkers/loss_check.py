        -----------------------------------   I. Introduction of the loss Check  -----------------------------------

        This class performs checks on the loss function in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In DRL,
        the loss function plays a key role in updating the agent's neural networks and guiding them towards the
        expected maximum reward. While the loss function in DRL is different from the loss in Deep Learning,
        it still needs to exhibit stable behavior to ensure efficient learning.

        The expected behavior of the loss function is that it starts from a high value and gradually decreases until
        it reaches 0. However, an unstable loss function can indicate potential issues that are destabilizing the
        learning or reducing the agent's performance.

        For example,in many DRL applications, it is recommended to use two separate copies of the network,
        known as the main and target network, which are updated at different periods. This technique helps stabilize
        the agent's learning process. However, choosing a low update period for the target network can lead to an
        unstable learning, which can be detected by observing the behavior of the loss function. In such cases,
        the loss would fluctuate excessively, indicating that the agent's performance is being negatively impacted by
        the update frequency of the target network.

        ------------------------------------------   II. The performed checks  -----------------------------------------

        The loss check class performs the following checks on the loss function during the training:
        (1) run the following pre-checks:

            a. Ensure correct reduction of the loss function (i.e. the loss estimation is based on average,
            not sum). This is more useful for custom loss function implementations.
            b. Verify that the optimizer's initial loss is as expected. An initial loss approximation can be
            calculated for most of the predefined loss functions. This function compares the model's initial loss to the
            calculated approximation.
        (2) Check the numerical instabilities of loss values. (check whether they have nan or infinite values)
        (3) Check the abnormal loss curvature of the loss (check the function check_loss_curve for more details)
            a. Non-or Slow-Decreasing loss.
            b. Diverging loss
            c. Highly-Fluctuating loss

        ------------------------------------   III. The potential Root Causes  -----------------------------------------

        The potential root causes behind the warnings that can be detected are
            - Using a bad loss function (checks triggered : 1,2,3)
            - Wrong implementation of the loss function (checks triggered : 1,2,3)
            - An unstable learning process (checks triggered : 2,3) :
                * Bad hyperparameters values
                * Low update period of the target network (a probel related to the agent in DRL)
                * Bad architecture of the model

        --------------------------------------   IV. The Recommended Fixes  --------------------------------------------

        The recommended fixes for the detected issues:
            - Change the loss function ( checks tha can be fixed: 1,2,3)
            - Verify that the loss function works correctly (checks tha can be fixed: 1,2,3)
            - Increase the update period of the target network (checks tha can be fixed: 2,3)
            - Change the architecture of the neural network (checks tha can be fixed: 2,3)

        Examples
        --------
